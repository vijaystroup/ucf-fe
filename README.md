# ucf-fe

### Overview
This project is meant for students at UCF. UCF-FE is designed to minimize your time practicing and studying for the foundation exam.
With this app, you no longer have to go back and forth to look at questions and answers, as well as keep going over the same test, "overfitting" your brain to that particular test instead of generalizing on the information (like machine learning!)

To use this application, visit <https://ucffe.vijaystroup.com>

Good luck passing the Foundation Exam!
